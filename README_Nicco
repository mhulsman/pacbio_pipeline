# Description of the files in this folder (Nicco)

- Snakemake_nicco --> Pipeline for the analysis of pacbio data. This pipeline does:
    1. check of md5 check-sum (when this is available)
    2. ccs algorithm (very shallow parameters for number of passes and read quality, to get as much output as possible)
    3. split hifi (number of passes >3 and read quality > 0.99) from non-hifi reads
    4. align hifi reads to GRCh38
    5. align non-hifi reads to GRCh38
    6. perform sample check to annotate the correct sample based on genotypes from Pacbio hifi and GWAS array data

- script_sample_check_v2.py --> Script to perform sample check procedure (step 6 above)

- check_files.R --> Script to double check the correct functioning of the pipeline
